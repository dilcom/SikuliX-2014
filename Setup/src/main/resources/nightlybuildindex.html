Available Downlods
<hr>
<a href="sikulixsetup-${sikuli.usedversion}.jar">sikulixsetup-${sikuli.usedversion}</a> (store and run in an empty folder)
<br><br>
The following jars would be downloaded automatically when running setup.
<br><br>
So you only would need to manually download, if you are having problems with setup's inline download.
<br>
If you download manually, the jars have to be in a folder Downloads in the folder containing sikulixsetup-X.Y.Z.jar.
<br>
Setup will find the local files and ask you to use them instead of downloading fresh versions.<br><br>
BE AWARE: These files are not useable for any other purpose than being processed by sikulixsetup.
<hr>
- <a href="${sikuli.usedversion}-1.jar">${sikuli.usedversion}-1</a> to get the SikuliX IDE (setup option1)<br>
- to use the IDE you must have at least one of the following (suboptions of setup option 1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="${sikuli.usedversion}-4.jar">${sikuli.usedversion}-4</a> scripting with Python/Jython<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="${sikuli.usedversion}-5.jar">${sikuli.usedversion}-5</a> scripting with Ruby/JRuby<br><br>
- if you want to use SikuliX with Java and Java aware languages (setup option 2) (now contained in sikulixsetup...jar)<br>
- <a href="${sikuli.minorversion}-8.jar">${sikuli.minorversion}-8</a> if you want to use the Tesseract based text features (setup option 3)<br>
- <a href="${sikuli.minorversion}-3.jar">${sikuli.minorversion}-3</a> if you want to try the experimental remote support (setup option 5)<br>
<hr>
As a special service for the users of sikulixapi.jar a ready to use jar (no setup needed) is available
for download from now on here.<br>
The only caveat: it is bigger, since it contains the native libraries for all systems.<br>
<a href="sikulixapi-${sikuli.usedversion}.jar">sikulixapi-${sikuli.usedversion}.jar</a><br>
This is part of the preparation for having it later on MavenCentral.<br>
