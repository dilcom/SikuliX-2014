fixed: IDE terminates on trying to open a non sikuli directory or an incorrect sikuli project<br>
fixed: possible loss of images at save (images in comments, images given with path)<br>
fixed: multi-monitor issues with respect to mouse actions (Screen(0) no longer is the primary monitor in all cases, but Screen.getPrimaryScreen() is)<br>
fixed: out-of-bounds crash during error eval when running from command line (thanks to github user fpmchu)<br>
fixed: IDE: NPE on termination when running from command line<br>
fixed: bug 1330348: running Java: ImagePath is set to working directory if no path is set before first image search<br>
fixed: possible NPE in special situations (mouse moved to invalid location)<br>

added: Screen.all() makes a ScreenUnion of all monitors, on Python level ALL is predefined and can be used as ALL.function() like a Screen/Region<br>
added: reset() to renew the multimonitor configuration inline on Python level<br>
added: Settings.OcrLanguage is now accepted by Tesseract (after using org.sikuli.script.TextRecognizer.reset())<br>
added: images can now be loaded from jars (see JavaDocs::ImagePath)<br>
revised: completely: observe processing (see JavaDocs for now)<br>
revised: further reduced error verbosity at script load and creating image thumbnails<br>
revised: class Mouse, added Mouse.at() to get the mouse location, external mouse moves are detected, mouse use should now be thread safe<br>
revised: moved the handling of capture and stop hotkey to HotkeyManager to prepare a more general usability (run on command line, using callbacks)<br>
revised: Region.write() and it's javadoc (alternative for type() with more features)<br>
